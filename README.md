# DWITE contest solutions

DWITE is a now-discontinued programming contest for high school students in Canada. While the competition came to an end in 2013, the questions are present online at https://dwite.org. This repository contains my Python solutions for the contest. This is an ongoing project that I'm working on because the problems are fun to solve.
